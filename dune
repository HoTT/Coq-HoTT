; Bench

; The following rule allows you to bench the running time of a file using
; "hyperfine". For this to work you must make a file called "file_to_bench"
; which contains the path to the file you want to bench (with brackets around
; it). For instance, if we wanted to bench the file
; "theories/WildCat/Products.v", we would make a file called "file_to_bench" with
; the following content:
;
; (theories/WildCat/Products.v)
;
; Afterwards you run "dune build @bench" and it will output the report.

(rule
 (alias bench)

  (alias bench-hint)

   (include file_to_bench)))
