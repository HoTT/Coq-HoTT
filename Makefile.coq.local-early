# Once https://github.com/coq/coq/pull/12411 is merged and we bump the
# minimum version to a version including that PR, this file should
# become Makefile.coq.local, and we should rename Makefile.coq.local
# to Makefile.coq.local-late; Makefile.coq.local-early contains code
# that overrides the relevant variables in Makefile.coq, while
# Makefile.coq.local currently contains additional targets that need
# access to the variables in Makefile.coq
