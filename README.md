[Homotopy Type Theory](http://homotopytypetheory.org/) is an interpretation of
Martin-Löf’s intensional type theory into abstract homotopy theory. Propositional equality
is interpreted as homotopy and type isomorphism as homotopy equivalence. Logical
constructions in type theory then correspond to homotopy-invariant constructions on
spaces, while theorems and even proofs in the logical system inherit a homotopical
meaning. As the natural logic of homotopy, type theory is also related to higher category
theory as it is used e.g. in the notion of a higher topos.

The HoTT library is a development of homotopy-theoretic ideas in the Coq proof assistant.
It draws many ideas from Vladimir Voevodsky's
[Foundations](https://github.com/vladimirias/Foundations) library (which has since been
incorporated into the [UniMath](https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath) library) and also
cross-pollinates with the [HoTT-Agda](https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT-Agda) library.

## INSTALLATION

Installation details are explained in the file [INSTALL.md](/INSTALL.md).

## USAGE

It is possible to use the HoTT library directly on the command line with the `hoqtop`
script, but who does that?

It is probably better to use [Proof General](http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk) and
[Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). When Proof General asks you where to find the
`coqtop` executable, just point it to the `hoqtop` script. If Emacs runs a `coqtop`
without asking, you should probably customize set the variable `proof-prog-name-ask` to
`nil` (in Emacs type `C-h v proof-prog-name-ask RET` to see what this is about).

There is also a script called `hoqide` that runs Coq's built-in GUI `coqide`
with `hoqtop` as the underlying `coqtop`.
