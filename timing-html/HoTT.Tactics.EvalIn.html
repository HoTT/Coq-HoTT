(** It sometimes happens, in the course of writing a tactic, that we have some term in an Ltac variable (more precisely, we have what Ltac calls a "constr") and we would like to act on it with some tactic such as [cbv] or [rewrite].  Ordinarily, such tactics only act on the current *goal*, and generally they have a version such as [rewrite ... in ...] which acts on something in the current *context*, but neither of these is the same as acting on a term held in an Ltac variable.

For some tactics, such as [cbv] and [pattern], we can write [eval TAC in H], where [H] is the term in question; this form *returns* the modified term so we can place it in another Ltac variable.  However, other tactics such as [rewrite] do not support this syntax.  (There is a feature request for it at https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3677.)

The following tactic [eval_in TAC H] fills this gap, allowing us to act by [rewrite] on terms in Ltac variables.  The argument [TAC] must be a tactic that takes one argument, which is an Ltac function that gets passed the name of a hypothesis to act on, such as [ltac:(fun H' =&gt; rewrite H in H')].  (Unfortunately, however, [eval_in] cannot be used to exactly generalize [eval pattern in H]; see below.)

There is also a variant called [eval_in_using], which also accepts a second user-specified tactic and uses it to solve side-conditions generated by the first one.  We actually define [eval_in] in terms of [eval_in_using] by passing [idtac] as the second tactic. *)</pre>

  (** The syntax [$(...)$] allows execution of an arbitrary tactic to supply a needed term.  By prefixing it with [constr:] which tells Ltac to expect a term, we obtain a pattern [constr:($(...)$)] which allows us to execute an arbitrary tactic in the situation of a fresh goal.   This way we avoid modifying the existing context, and we can also get our hands on a proof term corresponding to the stateful modification.  We pose [H] in the fresh context so we can play with it nicely, regardless of if it's a hypothesis or a term.  Then we run [tac_in] on the hypothesis to modify it, use [exact] to "return" the modified hypothesis, and give a nice error message if [using_tac] fails to solve some side-condition. *)

  (** Finally, we play some games to format the return value nicely.  We want to zeta-reduce the let-in generated by [pose], but not any other [let-in]s; we do this by matching for it and doing the substitution manually.  Additionally, [pose]/[exact] also results in an extra [idmap]; we remove this with [cbv beta], which unfortunately also beta-reduces everything else.  (This is why [eval_in pattern H] doesn't strictly generalize [eval pattern in H], since the latter doesn't beta-reduce.)  Perhaps we want to zeta-reduce everything, and not beta-reduce anything instead? *)

(** ** Rewriting with reflexivity *)

(** As an example application, we define a tactic that takes a lemma whose definition is [idpath] and behaves like [rewrite], except that it doesn't insert any transport lemmas like [Overture.internal_paths_rew_r].  In other words, it does a [change], but leverages the pattern-matching and substitution engine of [rewrite] to decide what to [change] into. *)
