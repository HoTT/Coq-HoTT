A development of homotopy-theoretic foundations of mathematics.

This is the repository for the Coq files of the [Homotopy Type Theory
project](http://homotopytypetheory.org/). You can fork this repository to
your own and then be automatically kept up to date on new developments. You
can also contribute back into it by sending a pull request.

You will need Coq version 8.3 or newer to compile the files.
