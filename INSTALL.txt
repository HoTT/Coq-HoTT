# QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Install a custom Coq from https://github.com/HoTT/coq. This is a fork
   of the trunk and is compatible with standard Coq 8.4 trunk, except that
   it supports special command-line options that turn on the homotopy theory
   interpretation.

2. Get the HoTT library at https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT.git.
 
3. If you installed custom Coq so that it is found in the `PATH`, run

       ./configure
       make

   If you installed custom Coq in a secret place, tell ./configure
   where to find it as follows:
   
       ./configure COQBIN=<absolute-directory-containing-coq-executables>
       make

4. You can now use the HoTT library in place by running ./hoqtop and ./hoqc.
   The library is loaded with `Require Import HoTT.Hopotopy`.

5. You can install the library globally with `make install`.


# LONG INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

## PREREQUISITES

The HoTT library requires a custom version of Coq which supports the command-line options
`-relevant-equality` and `-warn-universe-inconsistencies`. The first one changes the
interpretation of equality to one that conforms to the homotopy-theoretic interpretation,
while the second one is an ugly temporary hack that turns universe inconsistencies intro
warning rather than errors.

At present only a fork of the Coq trunk supports these options, but we hope to get them
into the official Coq soon. Unfortunately for you that means you will have to compile a
version of Coq, available at

   https://github.com/HoTT/coq

If you have never compiled Coq you may prefer to ask a friend for help. If you feel brave
you should try doing it yourself:

1. Obtain the custom Coq fork. If you have git clone the fork with

       git clone https://github.com/HoTT/coq.git

   If you do not have git, you may still download the files as an archive file at
   https://github.com/HoTT/coq/zipball/trunk (but it is better for you in the long run to
   learn git).

2. Compile Coq, as explained in the INSTALL.txt file of Coq distribution. You will need
   some prerequisites for compilation, such as OCaml 3.11.2 or later.

   If you do not want the custom Coq to override one that you already have installed,
   configure Coq with either `./configure -local` so that it will work in-place, or use
   `./configure -prefix <dir>`, as explained by `./configure -help`.


## INSTALLATION OF HoTT

Once you have installed the correct version of Coq, as explained in PREREQUISITES, you
proceed as follows. Clone the HoTT repository with

   git clone https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT.git

Even better, if you would like to contribute to HoTT, first fork the repository on
github and then use your own fork. This way you will be able to make pull requests.

If you do not want to deal with git at all, you may download an archive of HoTT at
https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/zipball/master and unpack that. We do not recommend this
option because the HoTT library is under heavy development and you want to be able to
easily track changes.

Next you should configure the HoTT library:

1. If you installed the custom Coq as your default version of Coq, which means that it
   it can be fond in PATH, run

       ./configure

   in the HoTT directory.

2. If you installed the custom Coq somewhere special or configured it with `-local`,
   you should tell ./configure where to find the custom Coq:

       ./configure COQBIN=<directory-containing-coq-executables>

   where you should specify the *absolute* path name (starting with /) of the
   directory which contains `coqtop`, `coqc`, etc.

To compile the HoTT library type

    make

Because it is a bit tricky to run Coq with a custom standard library, we provided
scripts `hoqtop` and `hoqc` that do this for you, so you can run

    ./hoqtop

directly from the HoTT directory to start using the library. Load it with

   Require Import HoTT.Homotopy.

There is also `hoqc` for compiling files. You may prefer to install `hoqtop`, `hoqc` and
the library files globally, in which case you type

    sudo make install

By default the files will be installed in `/usr/local/bin` and `/usr/local/share/hott`.
You can change the location by using standard `configure` parameters when you run it.
For example

    ./configure --bindir=$HOME/bin --datadir-$HOME/stuff

will install `hoqtop` and `hoqc` in the `bin` subdirectory of your home directory
and the HoTT library in `stuff/hott` subdirectory of your home directory.
