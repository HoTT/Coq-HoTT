# QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Get the HoTT library at https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT.git. Go to the
   root of the HoTT created directory.  You can use the commands

       git clone https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT.git
       cd HoTT

2. Run

       ./autogen.sh
       ./configure
       make

   If, at some point, when running make, you get errors about OCaml
   files (.ml, .mli), try running ((cd coq-HoTT && git clean -xfd))
   and then running the three commands above again; the likely cause
   is that the version of Coq we are using recently changed, and the
   old version is incompatible with the new one in ways that make had
   trouble figuring out.

   If you installed a custom Coq, and do not want to use the bundled
   version of Coq tell ./configure where to find it as follows:

       ./autogen.sh --without-bundled-coq
       ./configure COQBIN=<absolute-directory-containing-coq-executables>
       make

3. You can now use the HoTT library in place by running ./hoqtop and
   ./hoqc. You can also use ./hoqide which is the version of coqide
   running the hoqtop toplevel if you have compiled it successfully.

4. The library can be loaded with `Require Import HoTT.`

5. You can install the library globally with `make install
   install-coqlight`, although this has not been thoroughly tested.
   You can customize the install location by running

       ./autogen.sh
       ./configure --prefix=<install-location>
       make install-coqlight
       make install

6. To use the emacs tags facility with the *.v files here, run the command

   	make TAGS

   (The emacs command `M-x find-tag`, bound to `M-.` , will take you to
   a definition or theorem, the default name for which is located under
   your cursor. Read the help on that emacs command with `C-h k M-.` ,
   and learn the other facilities provided, such as the use of `M-*` to
   get back where you were, or the use of `M-x tags-search` to search
   throughout the code for locations matching a given regular
   expression.)

# LONG INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

## PREREQUISITES

The HoTT library requires a custom version of Coq which supports the the
command-line option `-indices-matter`, universe polymorphism and private
types. The first one changes the interpretation of equality to one that
conforms to the homotopy-theoretic interpretation, the second one is
needed to avoid certain universe inconsistency errors (which are not
really there but Coq 8.4 cannot see that), and the third one allows us
to implement higher-inductive types, sort of.

At present only our fork of the Coq trunk supports these options, but we
hope to get them into the official Coq soon. Unfortunately for you
that means you will have to compile a version of Coq, available at

   https://github.com/HoTT/coq

If you have never compiled Coq you may prefer to ask a friend for
help. Since we bundle the version of Coq we need, all that you must do
is obtain the necessary prerequisites, such as OCaml 3.11.2 or later.
After you run `./autogen.sh`, you can look at `coq-HoTT/INSTALL` and
`coq-HoTT/configure -help`.

## INSTALLATION OF HoTT

Once you have installed the necessary dependencies for Coq, as
explained in PREREQUISITES, you proceed as follows. Clone the HoTT
repository with

   git clone https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT.git

Even better, if you would like to contribute to HoTT, first fork the
repository on github and then use your own fork. This way you will be
able to make pull requests.

If you do not want to deal with git at all, you may download an
archive of HoTT at
https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/archive/master-with-autoreconf-files.zip
and unpack that. We do not recommend this option because the HoTT
library is under heavy development and you want to be able to easily
track changes.

Next you should configure the HoTT library:

1. If you want to use the bundled Coq, run

       ./autogen.sh
       ./configure

   in the HoTT directory.

2. If you want to use your own build of Coq, you should tell
   ./configure where to find the custom Coq:

       ./autogen.sh --without-bundled-coq
       ./configure COQBIN=<directory-containing-coq-executables>

   where you should specify the *absolute* path name (starting with /)
   of the directory which contains `coqtop`, `coqc`, etc.

To compile the HoTT library type

    make

Because it is a bit tricky to run Coq with a custom standard library,
we provided scripts `hoqtop` and `hoqc` that do this for you, so you
can run

    ./hoqtop

directly from the HoTT directory to start using the library. Load it
with

   Require Import HoTT.

There is also `hoqc` for compiling files. You may prefer to install
`hoqtop`, `hoqc` and the library files globally, in which case you
type

    sudo make install install-coqlight

By default the files will be installed in `/usr/local/bin` and
`/usr/local/share/hott`.  You can change the location by using
standard `configure` parameters when you run it.  For example

    ./configure --bindir=$HOME/bin --datadir=$HOME/stuff

will install `hoqtop` and `hoqc` in the `bin` subdirectory of your
home directory and the HoTT library in `stuff/hott` subdirectory of
your home directory.  Alternatively, you can use `--prefix`.

If you are using ProofGeneral (PG), do not forget to change the name
of the Coq program called by PG. For instance you can edit the name of
the executable called by PG by typing 'M-x customize-variable', then
'proof-prog-name' which displays a customization utility. An other
option is to type 'M-x customize-variable', then
'proof-prog-name-ask', to click on the 'Toogle' button in front of
Proof Prog Name Ask and to save this for future sessions. This will
prompt PG to ask you for the name of the coq toplevel to be used each
time you start evaluating a file.
