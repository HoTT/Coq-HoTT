(* By using impredicative set and functional extensionality, we can
   *define* a higher inductive type and prove its non-dependent
   computation rule.  Here we do the interval. *)

Definition interval : Set := forall (X : Set) (a b : X) (p : a == b), X.

Definition zero : interval := fun X a b p => a.

Definition one : interval := fun X a b p => b.

Definition segment : zero == one.
Proof.
  apply funext_dep with (f := zero) (g := one); intro X.
  apply funext_dep; intro a.
  apply funext_dep; intro b.
  apply funext_dep; intro p.
  unfold zero, one; exact p.
Defined.

Definition interval_rec : forall (X : Set) (a b : X) (p : a == b), interval -> X :=
  fun X a b p i => i X a b p.

(* It's sort of stupid to use this interval to prove functional
   extensionality, since we already had to assume funext in order to
   define [segment], but it shows that the computation rules really do
   hold definitionally. *)

     [funext_dep] in [segment].  Thus we just have to kill them off one
     by one from the inside out. *)
