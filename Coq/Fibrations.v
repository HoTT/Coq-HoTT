Unset Automatic Introduction.

(** In homotopy type theory, We think of elements of [Type] as spaces
   or homotopy types, while a type family [P : A -> Type] corresponds
   to a fibration whose base is [A] and whose fiber over [x] is [P x].

   From such a [P] we can build a total space over the base space [A]
   so that the fiber over [x : A] is [P x].  This is just Coq's
   dependent sum construction, written as [{x : A & P x}].  The
   elements of [{x : A & P x}] are pairs, written [existT P x y] in
   Coq, where [x : A] and [y : P x].

   The primitive notation for dependent sum is [sigT P].  Note,
   though, that in the absence of definitional eta expansion, this is
   not actually identical with [{x : A & P x}], since the latter
   desugars to [sigT (fun x => P x)].
   
   Finally, the base and fiber components of a point in the total
   space are extracted with [projT1] and [projT2]. *)
   
(** We can also define more familiar homotopy-looking aliases for all
   of these functions. *)

Notation "( x  ; y )" := (existT _ x y).
Notation pr1 := (@projT1 _ _).
Notation pr2 := (@projT2 _ _).

(** An element of [section P] is a global section of fibration [P]. *)

Definition section {A} (P : A -> Type) := forall x : A, P x.

(** We now study how paths interact with fibrations.  The most basic
   fact is that we can transport points in the fibers along paths in
   the base space.  This is actually a special case of the
   [paths_rect] induction principle in which the fibration [P] does
   not depend on paths in the base space but rather just on points of
   the base space. *)

(** A homotopy fiber for a map [f] at [y] is the space of paths of the
   form [f x == y].

(** We prove a lemma that explains how to transport a point in the
   homotopy fiber along a path in the domain of the map. *)
