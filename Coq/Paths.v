(** Basic homotopy-theoretic approach to paths. *)

Require Export Prelude.

(** We define the space of paths so that it matches the definitionof Coq
   equality [eq], except that we put paths in [Type] instead of [Prop].
   Older versions of HoTT had a different definition, but we want this
   one so that we can use Coq rewriting, which is a huge advantage.

   Note that we write [Universe] as the codomain of [paths]. This seems ugly,
   but if we write [Type] then Coq will infer that the codomain is [Prop]!
   Thus, for example the definition of [identity] in [Coq.Init.Datatypes] 
   lands in [Prop], even though the designers of the library probably
   did not have that in mind.
 *)

Inductive paths {A : Type} (x : A) : A -> Universe := idpath : paths x x.

(* The next line tells [coqdoc] to print [paths] as a wigly arrow in LaTeX. *)
(** printing == $\leadsto$ *)

(** We introduce notation [x == y] for the space [paths x y] of paths
   from [x] to [y]. We can then write [p : x == y] to indicate that
   [p] is a path from [x] to [y]. *)

Notation "x == y" := (paths x y) (at level 70).

(** The [Hint Resolve @idpath] line below means that Coq's [auto]
   tactic will automatically perform [apply idpath] if that leads to a
   successful solution of the current goal. For example if we ask it
   to construct a path [x == x], [auto] will find the identity path
   [idpath x], thanks to the [Hint Resolve].

   In general we should declare [Hint Resolve] on those theorems which
   are not very complicated but get used often to finish off
   proofs. Notice how we use the non-implicit version [@idpath] (if we
   try [Hint Resolve idpath] Coq complains that it cannot guess the
   value of the implicit argument [A]).  *)

Hint Resolve @idpath.

(** The following automated tactic applies induction on paths and then
    [auto], which will also try [idpath]. It can handle many easy
    statements. *)

Ltac path_induction :=
  intros; repeat progress (
    match goal with
      | [ p : _ == _  |- _ ] => induction p
      | _ => idtac
    end
  ); auto.

(** You can read the above tactic definition as follows. We first perform
   [intros] to move hypotheses into the context. Then we repeat while there
   is still progress: if there is a path [p] in the context, apply
   induction to it, otherwise perform the [idtac] which does nothing (and
   so no progress is made and we stop). After that, we perform an [auto].

   The notation [ [... |- ... ] ] is a pattern for contexts. To the left of
   the symbol [|-] we list hypotheses and to the right the goal. The
   underscore means "anything".

   In summary [path_induction] performs as many inductions on paths as it
   can, then it uses [auto]. *)

(** We now define the basic operations on paths, starting with concatenation. *)

Definition concat {A} {x y z : A} : (x == y) -> (y == z) -> (x == z).
Proof.
  intros p q.
  induction p.
  exact q.
Defined.

(** The concatenation of paths [p] and [q] is denoted as [p @ q]. *)

Notation "p @ q" := (concat p q) (at level 60).

(** A definition like [concat] can be used in two ways. The first and
   obvious way is as an operation which concatenates together two
   paths. The second use is a proof tactic when we want to construct a
   path [x == z] as a concatenation of paths [x == y == z]. This is
   done with [apply @concat], see examples below. We will actually
   define a tactic [path_via] which uses [concat] but is much smarter
   than just the direct application [apply @concat]. *)

(** Paths can be reversed. *)

Definition opposite {A} {x y : A} : (x == y) -> (y == x).
Proof.
  intros p.
  induction p.
  apply idpath.
Defined.

(** Notation for the opposite of a path [p] is [! p]. *)

Notation "! p" := (opposite p) (at level 50).

(** Next we give names to the basic properties of concatenation of
   paths. Note that all statements are "up to a higher path", e.g.,
   the composition of [p] and the identity path is not equal to [p]
   but only connected to it with a path. *)

(** We are going to create a rewrite hints database called [paths], to
   be used with the rewriting facilities. We must be a bit careful about
   putting hints in [paths], lest we end up with a cycle of rewrite
   rules that will spin forever. What is needed is a well-founded
   measure which guarantees that the left-hand side of a rewrite rule is
   larger than the right-hand size. Here is an attempt to describe
   such a measure. It is the lexicographic order of the following
   simpler measures, where the most significant measure comes first:

   - depth at which [map_dep] occurs
   - number of occurences of [concat]
   - depth at which [transport] occurs
   - depth at which [happly] occurs
   - number of occurences of [composition]
   - depth at which [map] occurs
   - depth at which [opposite] occurs
   - number if occurences of [idpath]
   - size of the expression

   This means, that in each rewrite rule that is added to the [paths]
   hints database, the number of occurences of [map_dep] has to decrease, or
   stay the same and the number of occurences of [concat] has to
   decrease, or stay the same and...., or the size of the formula has to
   decrease.

   [!p], makes no progress, and stops.  In such a situation one must
