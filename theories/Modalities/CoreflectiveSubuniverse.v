(** * Coreflective subuniverses. *)

(** In this file we study "coreflective subuniverses" that are defined dually to reflective subuniverses.  However, it turns out that there are many fewer examples of these.  The "internal" nature of such definitions, which in the reflective case makes the subuniverse automatically an exponential ideal, in the coreflective case has much stronger consequences: it forces the entire coreflection to be determined by the image of [Unit], which can be an arbitrary hprop.  Thus, this file is essentially just a no-go theorem: there are no coreflective subuniverses other than a certain class of fairly simple ones (which we call "co-open" since they are dual to open modalities).

In particular, since we do not foresee many applications of this file, we don't bother introducing modules to make the definitions more universe polymorphic the way we did for reflective subuniverses. *)

(** Conversely, we will now show that for any hprop [U], the types [X] such that [X -> U] are a coreflective subuniverse, which we call "co-open" since it is dual to the open modality. *)

Section CoOpen.
  Context `{Funext} (U : hProp).

  Definition coOp : CoreflectiveSubuniverse.
  Proof.
    simple refine (Build_CoreflectiveSubuniverse

  Defined.

  (** Thus, each coreflective subuniverses are uniquely determined by an hprop.  Moreover, the coreflective subuniverse corresponding to an hprop [U] is closely related to the open modality [Op U].  Specifically, they form an _adjoint modality pair_ in the sense that the subuniverses are canonically equivalent, and the coreflection and reflection respect this equivalence.  In categorical language, this says that the inclusion of an open subtopos is the center of a local geometric morphism in the other direction.  We express this concisely as follows. *)
