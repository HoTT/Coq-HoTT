(** In the Overture, we defined function extensionality to be the assertion that the map [apD10] is an equivalence.   We now prove that this follows from a couple of weaker-looking forms of function extensionality.  We do require eta conversion, which Coq 8.4+ has judgmentally.

   This proof is originally due to Voevodsky; it has since been simplified by Peter Lumsdaine and Michael Shulman. *)

(** Naive funext is the simple assertion that pointwise equal functions are equal. *)

Definition NaiveFunext :=
  forall (A : Type) (P : A -> Type) (f g : forall x, P x),
    (forall x, f x = g x) -> (f = g).

(** Weak funext says that a product of contractible types is contractible. *)

Definition WeakFunext :=
  forall (A : Type) (P : A -> Type),
    (forall x, Contr (P x)) -> Contr (forall x, P x).

(** The obvious implications are

Definition NaiveFunext_implies_WeakFunext : NaiveFunext -> WeakFunext.
Proof.
  intros nf A P Pc.

  intros f; apply nf; intros x.
  apply contr.
Defined.

(** The less obvious direction is that WeakFunext implies Funext (and hence all three are logically equivalent).  The point is that under weak funext, the space of "pointwise homotopies" has the same universal property as the space of paths. *)

    (* The trick is to show that the type [{g : forall x, B x & f == g }] is a retract of [forall x, {y : B x & f x = y}], which is contractible due to J and weak funext.  Here are the retraction and its section. *)
