(** In the Overture, we defined function extensionality to be the assertion that the map [apD10] is an equivalence.   We now prove that this follows from a couple of weaker-looking forms of function extensionality.  We do require eta conversion, which Coq 8.4+ has judgmentally.

   This proof is originally due to Voevodsky; it has since been simplified by Peter Lumsdaine and Michael Shulman. *)

(** Naive funext is the simple assertion that pointwise equal functions are equal.  The domain and codomain could live in different universes; the third universe argument is essentially the max of [i] and [j] (and similarly for all subsequent axioms). *)

(** ** Naive non-dependent funext implies weak funext  *)

(** First we show that naive non-dependent funext suffices to show that postcomposition with an equivalence is an equivalence. *)

          (fun g => nf _ _ _ _ (fun y => eissect f (g y)))).

(** Now, if each [P x] is contractible, the projection [pr1 : {x:X & P x} -> X] is an equivalence (this requires no funext).  Thus, postcomposition with it is also an equivalence, and hence the fiber of postcomposition over [idmap X] is contractible.  But this fiber is "the type of sections of [pr1]" and hence equivalent to [forall x:X, P x].  The latter equivalence requires full funext to prove, but without any funext we can show that [forall x:X, P x] is a *retract* of the type of sections, hence also contractible. *)
Theorem NaiveNondepFunext_implies_WeakFunext
  : NaiveNondepFunext -> WeakFunext.
Proof.
  intros nf X P H.

Defined.

(** Therefore, naive nondependent funext also implies full funext.  Interestingly, this requires the universe of the assumption codomain to be not just that of the conclusion codomain, but the max of that universe with the domain universe (which is unchanged). *)
