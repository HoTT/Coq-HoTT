(* with. USING SUCH AUTOMATION TO BUILD THE BODY OF DEFINITIONS IS DANGEROUS. *)
(* See the example of concat2 below *)

(* command ending the script governing its definition, then it is probably a bad*)
(* idea in general to use an automation tactic such as hott_simpl in its script,*)

(* Definition ... := .... syntax. Actually, even without using automation, defs *)
(* of transparent constants via tactics is dangerous as well (see the legacy def*)

(* to scale, we should buld terms using identified combinators and/or explicit *)
