(** * The wild 1-category of 0-groupoids. *)

(** Here we define a wild 1-category structure on the type of 0-groupoids.  We think of the 1-cells [g $== h] in a 0-groupoid [G] as a substitute for the paths [g = h], and so we closely follow the definitions used for the 1-category of types with [=] replaced by [$==].  In fact, the 1-category structure on types should be the pullback of the 1-category structure on 0-groupoids along a natural map [Type -> ZeroGpd] which sends [A] to [A] equipped with its path types.  A second motivating example is the 0-groupoid with underlying type [A -> B] and homotopies as the 1-cells.  The definitions chosen here exactly make the Yoneda lemma [opyon_equiv_0gpd] go through. *)

(** We define equivalences of 0-groupoids as the bi-invertible maps, using [Cat_BiInv] and [Cat_IsBiInv].  This definition is chosen to provide what is needed for the Yoneda lemma, and because it specializes to one of the correct definitions for types. *)

I couldn't find a solution, so instead here is a helper function to manually do the coercion when needed. *)

(** ** [f] is an equivalence of 0-groupoids iff [IsSurjInj f]

  We now give a different characterization of the equivalences of 0-groupoids, as the injective split essentially surjective 0-functors, which are defined in EquivGpd.  Advantages of this logically equivalent formulation are that it tends to be easier to prove in examples and that in some cases it is definitionally equal to [ExtensionAlong], which is convenient.  See Homotopy/Suspension.v and Algebra/AbGroups/Abelianization for examples. Advantages of the bi-invertible definition are that it reproduces a definition that is equivalent to [IsEquiv] when applied to types, assuming [Funext].  It also works in any 1-category. *)
