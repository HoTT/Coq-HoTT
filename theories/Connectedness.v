(** ** Connectedness *)

(** There is a slight controversy of indexing for connectedness — in particular, how the indexing for maps shoud relate to the indexing for types.  One may reasonably take the connectedness of a map to correspond either to that of its *fibers*, or of its *cofiber*; these differ by 1.  The traditional topological indexing uses the cofiber.  We use the fiber, as does Lurie in [HTT]; but we choose to agree with the traditional indexing on types, while Lurie agrees with it on maps.

Currently, the translation is therefore as follows:

       HoTT              Traditional       Lurie

Map    (n-1)-connected   n-connected       n-connective
Type   n-connected       n-connected       (n+1)-connective

A handy benchmark: under our indexing, the map [S1 -> 1] is 0-connected but not 1-connected, while the map [1 -> S1] is (–1)–connected but not 0-connected.

There is also a technical choice to be made in the definition.  Connectedness can either be defined as contractibility of the truncation, or by elimination into truncated types.  The former requires HIT’s, but keeps the type [IsConnected] small; the latter, which we use for now, requires only core Coq, but blows up the size (universe leve) of [IsConnected], since it quantifies over types. 

Q: is there a definition of connectedness that neither blows up the universe level, nor requires HIT’s? *)

(** ** Extensions 

Elimination properties can be nicely phrased as the existence of extensions along maps of sections.

(** ** Connectivity of the wedge into the product.

A very useful form of the key lemma [istrunc_extension_along_conn] is the connectivity of the wedge into the product, for a pair of pointed spaces.  In fact this can be formulated without mentioning the wedge per se (so, without requiring HIT’s), since the statement only needs to talk about maps out of the wedge.

Once again, we believe that the type of the conclusion is an hprop (though we do not prove it) — essentially because it is wrapping up an elimination principle and its corresponding computation rule — and so we make the proof of this result opaque. *)
