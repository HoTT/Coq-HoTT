(** The following tactic proves automatically that a two-component record type is equivalent to a Sigma-type.  Specifically, it proves a goal that looks like
<<
   { x : A & B x } <~> Some_Record
>>
   You have to give it the record constructor and the two record projections as arguments (it has no way to guess what those might be). *)
