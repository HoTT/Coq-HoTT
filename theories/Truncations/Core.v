Local Open Scope path_scope.
Generalizable Variables A X n.

(** ** The definition *)

(** The definition of [Trunc n], the n-truncation of a type.

If Coq supported higher inductive types natively, we would construct this as something like:

   Inductive Trunc n (A : Type) : Type :=
   | tr : A -> Trunc n A
   | istrunc_truncation : forall (f : Sphere n.+1 -> Trunc n A)
       (x : Sphere n.+1), f x = f North.

However, while we are faking our higher-inductives anyway, we can take some shortcuts, rather than translating the definition above.  Firstly, we directly posit a “constructor” giving truncatedness, rather than rephrasing it in terms of maps of spheres.  Secondly, we omit the “computation rule” for this constructor, since it is implied by truncatedness of the result type (and, for essentially that reason, is never wanted in practice anyway).

    : (forall a, P (tr a)) -> (forall aa, P aa)
    := fun f aa => match aa with tr a => fun _ => f a end Pt.

End Trunc.

(** See [strip_reflections] and [strip_modalities] for generalizations to other reflective subuniverses and modalities.  We provide this version because it sometimes needs fewer universes (due to the cumulativity of [Trunc]).  However, that same cumulativity sometimes causes free universe variables.  For a hypothesis of type [Trunc@{i} X], we can use [Trunc_ind@{i j}], but sometimes Coq uses [Trunc_ind@{k j}] with [i <= k] and [k] otherwise free.  In these cases, [strip_reflections] and/or [strip_modalities] may generate fewer universe variables. *)

Coercion Tr : trunc_index >-> Modality.
(** However, if the coercion is not printed, then we get things like [Tr (-1) X] being printed as [(-1) X], which is terribly confusing.  So we tell Coq to always print this coercion.  This does mean that although the user can type things like [IsConnected n X], it will always be displayed back as [IsConnected (Tr n) X]. *)
