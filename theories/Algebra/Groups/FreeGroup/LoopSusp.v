(** In this file we experiment with defining the free group on [A] to be the fundamental group of the suspension of [A + Unit]. *)

(** Note that this is NOT the definition of a free group that is used in the library. The definition in use will be exported in the file Algebra.Groups.FreeGroup. This file merely exists to serve as a demonstration that the free group *could* be defined this way.

This is not a very practical definition because we cannot even show that it is free at the time of writing, and univalence is used in a crucial way which seems overkill for a definition of freegroup. *)

  (** This in theory would allow us to prove that this definition of a free group is in fact a free group. We however run into trouble.

Coq struggles a lot working with the extreme amount of data needed to be unfolded here as well. Therefore we leave this instance as aborted. *)
