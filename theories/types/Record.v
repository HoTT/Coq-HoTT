(** The following tactic proves automatically that a two-component record type is equivalent to a Sigma-type.  You have to give it the fibration that the Sigma-type is the total space of, the record constructor, and the two record projections as arguments. *)

      (* Since Coq doesn't automatically define recursors for records, the following placeholder has to be a match over the record type.  But we can't write that match without knowing the record constructors, and having the tactic caller pass them in doesn't seem to be enough.  So we leave this term to be defined with tactics instead. *)

(* It would be nice to do this without adjointifying, but since we lack a transparent assert, that seems like it would require giving the missing placeholder as an explicit term, as the triangle identity depends on its value. *)

(** We show how it works in a couple of examples. *)

Definition issig_contr (A : Type)
  : { x : A & forall y:A, x = y } <~> Contr A.
Proof.
  issig (fun x:A => forall y, x=y) (BuildContr A) (@center A) (@contr A).
Defined.

Definition issig_equiv (A B : Type)
  : { f : A -> B & IsEquiv f } <~> Equiv A B.
Proof.
  issig (@IsEquiv A B) (BuildEquiv A B) (equiv_fun A B) (equiv_isequiv A B).
Defined.

(** The function [equiv_rect] says that if [f : A -> B] is an equivalence, and we have a fibration over [B] which has a section once pulled back to [A], then it has a section over all of [B].  *)

Generalizable Variables A B f.

Definition equiv_rect `{IsEquiv A B f} (P : B -> Type)
  : (forall x:A, P (f x)) -> forall y:B, P y
  := fun g y => transport P (eisretr f y) (g (f^-1 y)).

Arguments equiv_rect {A B} f {_} P _ _.

(** Using [equiv_rect], we define a little tactic which introduces a variable and simultaneously substitutes it along an equivalence. *)

Ltac equiv_intro E x :=
  match goal with
    | |- forall y, @?Q y =>
      refine (equiv_rect E Q _); intros x
  end.

(** Combining [issig_contr] and [equiv_intro], we can transfer the problem of showing contractibility of [Contr A] to the equivalent problem of contractibility of a certain Sigma-type, in which case we can apply the general path-construction functions. *)

Instance contr_contr `{Funext} (A : Type)
  : Contr A -> Contr (Contr A).
Proof.
  intros c; exists c; generalize c.
  equiv_intro (issig_contr A) c'.
  equiv_intro (issig_contr A) d'.
  refine (ap _ _).
  refine (path_sigma _ _ _ ((contr (c'.1))^ @ contr (d'.1)) _).
  refine (path_forall _ _ _); intros x.
  apply path2_contr.
Qed.

(** Here is a version of the [issig] tactic for three-component records.  In this case, the first argument is a doubly dependent type of the form [forall (x:A) (y:B x), C x y].  Next comes the record constructor and the three projections, as before. *)

(** The record [IsEquiv] has four components, so [issig3] can prove that it is equivalent to an iterated Sigma-type. *)

Defined.

(** Here are the beginnings of a proof that [IsEquiv f] is an h-proposition, demonstrating again how [issig3_isequiv] and [equiv_intro] reduce the problem from one involving records to one involving Sigma-types. *)

Definition prop_isequiv `{Funext} {A B : Type} (f : A -> B) (e1 e2 : IsEquiv f)
  : e1 = e2.
Proof.
  revert e2; generalize e1.

  equiv_intro (issig3_isequiv f) h2.
  refine (ap _ _).
  destruct h1 as [g1 [r1 [s1 a1]]].
  destruct h2 as [g2 [r2 [s2 a2]]].
