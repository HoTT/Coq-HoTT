  (** ** Unit + UMP definition of adjunction *)
  (** Quoting from Awody's "Category Theory":

      An adjunction between categories [C] and [D] consists of
      functors

      [F : C <-> D : G]

      and a natural transformation

      [T : 1_C -> G ∘ F]

      with the property:

      (o) For any [c : C], [d : D], and [f : c -> G d], there exists a
          unique [g : F c -> d] such that [f = (G g) ∘ (T c)] as
          indicated in

<<
                g
     F c ..................> d

                 G g
     G (F c) --------------> G d

     Terminology and notation:

     - [F] is called the left adjoint, [G] is called the right
       adjoint, and [T] is called the unit of the adjunction.

     - One sometimes writes [F -| G] for ``[F] is left and [G] right
       adjoint.''

     - The statement (o) is the UMP of the unit [T].

     Note that the situation [F ⊣ G] is a generalization of
     equivalence of categories, in that a pseudo-inverse is an
     adjoint. In that case, however, it is the relation between
     categories that one is interested in. Here, one is concerned with
     the relation between special functors. That is to say, it is not
     the relation on categories ``there exists an adjunction,'' but
     rather ``this functor has an adjoint'' that we are concerned
     with. *)

  (** ** Unit + Counit + Zig + Zag definition of adjunction *)
  (** Quoting Wikipedia on Adjoint Functors:

      A counit-unit adjunction between two categories [C] and [D]
      consists of two functors [F : C ← D] and [G : C → D] and two
      natural transformations

<<
      ε : FG → 1_C
      η : 1_D → GF
>>

      respectively called the counit and the unit of the adjunction
      (terminology from universal algebra), such that the compositions

<<
          F η            ε F
      F -------> F G F -------> F

          η G            G ε
      G -------> G F G -------> G
>>

      are the identity transformations [1_F] and [1_G] on [F] and [G]
      respectively.

      In this situation we say that ``[F] is left adjoint to [G]'' and
      ''[G] is right adjoint to [F]'', and may indicate this
      relationship by writing [(ε, η) : F ⊣ G], or simply [F ⊣ G].

      In equation form, the above conditions on (ε, η) are the
      counit-unit equations

<<
      1_F = ε F ∘ F η
      1_G = G ε ∘ η G
>>

      which mean that for each [X] in [C] and each [Y] in [D],

<<
      1_{FY} = ε_{FY} ∘ F(η_Y)
      1_{GX} = G(ε_X) ∘ η_{GX}
>>

      These equations are useful in reducing proofs about adjoint
      functors to algebraic manipulations.  They are sometimes called
      the ``zig-zag equations'' because of the appearance of the
      corresponding string diagrams.  A way to remember them is to
      first write down the nonsensical equation [1 = ε ∘ η] and then
      fill in either [F] or [G] in one of the two simple ways which
      make the compositions defined.

      Note: The use of the prefix ``co'' in counit here is not
      consistent with the terminology of limits and colimits, because
      a colimit satisfies an initial property whereas the counit
      morphisms will satisfy terminal properties, and dually.  The
      term unit here is borrowed from the theory of monads where it
      looks like the insertion of the identity 1 into a monoid.  *)
