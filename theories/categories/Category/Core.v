(** Quoting the HoTT Book: *)
(** Definition 9.1.1. A precategory [A] consists of the following.

    (i) A type [A₀] of objects. We write [a : A] for [a : A₀].

    (ii) For each [a, b : A], a set [hom_A(a, b)] of arrows or morphisms.

    (iii) For each [a : A], a morphism [1ₐ : hom_A(a, a)].

    (iv) For each [a, b, c : A], a function

         [hom_A(b, c) → hom_A(a, b) → hom_A(a, c)]

         denoted infix by [g ↦ f ↦ g ∘ f] , or sometimes simply by [g f].

    (v) For each [a, b : A] and [f : hom_A(a, b)], we have [f = 1_b ∘
        f] and [f = f ∘ 1ₐ].

    (vi) For each [a, b, c, d : A] and [f : hom_A(a, b)], [g :
         hom_A(b, c)], [h : hom_A(c,d)], we have [h ∘ (g ∘ f) = (h ∘
         g) ∘ f]. *)
(** In addition to these laws, we ask for a few redundant laws to give
    us more judgmental equalities.  For example, since [(p^)^ ≢ p] for
    paths [p], we ask for the symmetrized version of the associativity
    law, so we can swap them when we take the dual. *)
