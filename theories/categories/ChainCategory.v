(** ** Definitions *)
(** Quoting Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order##Chains):

    While chain is sometimes merely a synonym for totally ordered set,
    it can also refer to a totally ordered subset of some partially
    ordered set. The latter definition has a crucial role in Zorn's
    lemma. *)
(** We take the convention that a "chain" is a totally ordered or
    linearly ordered set; the corresponding category on that set has,
    as morphisms, the order relation. *)
(* N.B. The notation here (including that [[n]] have as objects the
   set [{0, 1, ..., n}]) was originally suggested by David Spivak.
   It's possible that we should pick a different or more common
   terminology. *)

  (** *** [[n]], a linear order on a finite set with [n + 1] elements *)
  (** Using [n + 1] elements allows us to agree with the common
      definition of an [n]-simplex, where a 0-simplex is a point, and
      a 1-simplex has two end-points, etc. *)

      (total?) orders on them? *)
