(** Quoting Wikipedia on the Yoneda lemma (chainging [A] to [a] and
    [C] to [A] so that we can use unicode superscripts and
    subscripts):

    In mathematics, specifically in category theory, the Yoneda lemma
    is an abstract result on functors of the type morphisms into a
    fixed object. It is a vast generalisation of Cayley's theorem from
    group theory (viewing a group as a particular kind of category
    with just one object). It allows the embedding of any category
    into a category of functors (contravariant set-valued functors)
    defined on that category. It also clarifies how the embedded
    category, of representable functors and their natural
    transformations, relates to the other objects in the larger
    functor category. It is an important tool that underlies several
    modern developments in algebraic geometry and representation
    theory. It is named after Nobuo Yoneda.

    ** Generalities

    The Yoneda lemma suggests that instead of studying the (locally
    small) category [A], one should study the category of all functors
    of [A] into [Set] (the category of sets with functions as
    morphisms). [Set] is a category we understand well, and a functor
    of [A] into [Set] can be seen as a "representation" of [A] in
    terms of known structures. The original category [A] is contained
    in this functor category, but new objects appear in the functor
    category which were absent and "hidden" in [A]. Treating these new
    objects just like the old ones often unifies and simplifies the
    theory.  This approach is akin to (and in fact generalizes) the
    common method of studying a ring by investigating the modules over
    that ring. The ring takes the place of the category [A], and the
    category of modules over the ring is a category of functors
    defined on [A].

    ** Formal statement

    *** General version

    Yoneda's lemma concerns functors from a fixed category [A] to the
    category of sets, [Set]. If [A] is a locally small category
    (i.e. the hom-sets are actual sets and not proper classes), then
    each object [a] of [A] gives rise to a natural functor to [Set]
    called a hom-functor. This functor is denoted:

    [hᵃ = Hom(a, ─)].

    The (covariant) hom-functor [hᵃ] sends [x] to the set of morphisms
    [Hom(a, x)] and sends a morphism [f] from [x] to [y] to the
    morphism [f ∘ ─] (composition with [f] on the left) that sends a
    morphism [g] in [Hom(a, x)] to the morphism [f ∘ g] in [Hom(a,
    y)]. That is,

    [f ↦ Hom(a, f) = ⟦ Hom(a, x) ∋ g ↦ f ∘ g ∈ Hom(a,y) ⟧].

(** ** The Yoneda embedding

    An important special case of Yoneda's lemma is when the functor
    [F] from [A] to [Set] is another hom-functor [hᵇ]. In this case,
    the covariant version of Yoneda's lemma states that

    [Nat(hᵃ, hᵇ) ≅ Hom(b, a)].

    That is, natural transformations between hom-functors are in
    one-to-one correspondence with morphisms (in the reverse
    direction) between the associated objects. Given a morphism [f : b
    → a] the associated natural transformation is denoted [Hom(f, ─)].

    Mapping each object [a] in [A] to its associated hom-functor [hᵃ=
    Hom(a, ─)] and each morphism [f : B → A] to the corresponding
    natural transformation [Hom(f, ─)] determines a contravariant
    functor [h⁻] from [A] to [Setᴬ], the functor category of all
    (covariant) functors from [A] to [Set]. One can interpret [h⁻] as
    a covariant functor:

    [h⁻ : Aᵒᵖ → Setᴬ].

    The meaning of Yoneda's lemma in this setting is that the functor
    [h⁻] is fully faithful, and therefore gives an embedding of [Aᵒᵖ]
    in the category of functors to [Set]. The collection of all
    functors {[hᵃ], [a] in [A]} is a subcategory of [Set̂ᴬ]. Therefore,
    Yoneda embedding implies that the category [Aᵒᵖ] is isomorphic to
    the category {[hᵃ], [a] in [A]}.

    The contravariant version of Yoneda's lemma states that

    [Nat(hₐ, h_b) ≅ Hom(a, b)].

    Therefore, [h₋] gives rise to a covariant functor from [A] to the
    category of contravariant functors to [Set]:

    [h₋ : A → Set⁽⁽ᴬ⁾ᵒᵖ⁾].

    Yoneda's lemma then states that any locally small category [A] can
    be embedded in the category of contravariant functors from [A] to
    [Set] via [h₋]. This is called the Yoneda embedding. *)
