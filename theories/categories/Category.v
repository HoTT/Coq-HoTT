(** We don't want to make utf-8 notations the default, so we don't export them. *)

(** ** Subcategories *)
(** For the subfolders, we need to re-create the module structure.  Alas, namespacing in Coq is kind-of broken (see, e.g., https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3676), so we don't get the ability to rename subfolders by [Including] into other modules. *)
