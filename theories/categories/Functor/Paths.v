  (** We could leave it at that and be done with it, but we want a more convenient form for actually constructing paths between functors.  For this, we write a trimmed down version of something equivalent to the type of paths between functors. *)

  (** We could just go prove that the path space of [functor_sig_T] is equivalent to [path_functor'_T], but unification is far too slow to do this effectively.  So instead we explicitly classify [path_functor'_T], and provide an equivalence between it and the path space of [Functor C D]. *)
