(** We save [inl] and [inr] so we can use them to refer to the functors, too.  Outside of the [categories/] directory, they should always be referred to as [Functor.inl] and [Functor.inr], after a [Require Functor].  Outside of this file, but in the [categories/] directory, if you do not want to depend on all of [Functor] (for e.g., speed reasons), they should be referred to as [Functor.Sum.inl] and [Functor.Sum.inr] after a [Require Functor.Sum]. *)
