  (** Quoting from the lecture notes for MIT's 18.705, Commutative Algebra:

      A map of categories is known as a functor. Namely, given
      categories [C] and [C'], a (covariant) functor [F : C -> C'] is
      a rule that assigns to each object [A] of [C] an object [F A] of
      [C'] and to each map [m : A -> B] of [C] a map [F m : F A -> F
      B] of [C'] preserving composition and identity; that is,

     (1) [F (m' ∘ m) = (F m') ∘ (F m)] for maps [m : A -> B] and [m' :
         B -> C] of [C], and

     (2) [F (id A) = id (F A)] for any object [A] of [C], where [id A]
         is the identity morphism of [A]. **)

  Record Functor :=
    {
      object_of :> C -> D;
      morphism_of : forall s d, morphism C s d
                                -> morphism D (object_of s) (object_of d);
      composition_of : forall s d d'
                              (m1 : morphism C s d) (m2: morphism C d d'),
                         morphism_of _ _ (m2 o m1)
                         = (morphism_of _ _ m2) o (morphism_of _ _ m1);

                              = identity (object_of x)
