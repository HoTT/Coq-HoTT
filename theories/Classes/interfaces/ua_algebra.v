(** A [Signature] is used to characterise [Algebra]s. In particular
    a signature specifies which operations (functions) an algebra for
    the signature is expected to provide. A signature consists of
    - A type of [Sort]s. An algebra for the signature must provide
      a type for each [s : Sort].
    - A type of function symbols [Symbol]. For each function symbol
      [u : Symbol], an algebra for the signature must provide a
      corresponding operation.
    - The field [symbol_types σ u] indicates which type the operation
      corresponding to [u] should have. *)
