Arguments SetAlgebra : clear implicits.

(** To find a path [A = B] between set algebras [A B : SetAlgebra σ],
    it is enough to find a path between the defining algebras,
    [algebra_setalgebra A = algebra_setalgebra B]. *)

Lemma path_setalgebra `{Funext} {σ} (A B : SetAlgebra σ)
  (p : algebra_setalgebra A = algebra_setalgebra B)
  : A = B.
Proof.
  destruct A as [A AH], B as [B BH]. cbn in *.
  transparent assert (a : (p#AH = BH)) by apply path_ishprop.
  by path_induction.
Defined.

(** The id path is mapped to the id path by [path_setalgebra]. *)

Lemma path_setalgebra_1 `{Funext} {σ} (A : SetAlgebra σ)
  : path_setalgebra A A idpath = idpath.
Proof.
  transparent assert (p :
      (∀ I : IsHSetAlgebra A, path_ishprop I I = idpath)).
  - intros. apply path_ishprop.
  - unfold path_setalgebra. by rewrite p.
Qed.

(** The function [path_setalgebra A B] is an equivalence with inverse
    [ap algebra_setalgebra]. *)

Instance isequiv_path_setalgebra `{Funext} {σ : Signature}
  (A B : SetAlgebra σ)
  : IsEquiv (path_setalgebra A B).
