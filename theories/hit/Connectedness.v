(** There is a slight controversy of indexing for connectedness — in particular, how the indexing for maps shoud relate to the indexing for types.  One may reasonably take the connectedness of a map to correspond either to that of its *fibers*, or of its *cofiber*; these differ by 1.  The traditional topological indexing uses the cofiber.  We use the fiber, as does Lurie in [HTT]; but we choose to agree with the traditional indexing on types, while Lurie agrees with it on maps.

Currently, the translation is therefore as follows:

       HoTT              Traditional       Lurie

Map    (n-1)-connected   n-connected       n-connective
Type   n-connected       n-connected       (n+1)-connective

A handy benchmark: under our indexing, the map [S1 -> 1] is 0-connected but not 1-connected, while the map [1 -> S1] is (–1)–connected but not 0-connected.


One reason for our choice is that this way, the n-truncated and n-connected maps are the modal and modally-connected maps for the n-truncation modality.  Many of the basic lemmas about connected maps are in fact true for any modality, and can be found in [Modality.v].  Thus, here we consider mainly properties that involve the interaction of connectedness at different truncation levels. *)

(** ** Truncatedness of the type of extensions *)

(** A key lemma on the interaction between connectedness and truncatedness: suppose one is trying to extend along an n-connected map, into a k-truncated family of types (k ≥ n).  Then the space of possible extensions is (k–n–2)-truncated.

(Mnemonic for the indexing: think of the base case, where k=n; then we know we can eliminate, so the space of extensions is contractible.)

This lemma is most useful via corollaries like the wedge-inclusion, the wiggly wedge, and their n-ary generalizations. *)

Section Wedge_Incl_Conn.

(** ** Connectivity of the wedge into the product.

A very useful form of the key lemma [istrunc_extension_along_conn] is the connectivity of the wedge into the product, for a pair of pointed spaces.  In fact this can be formulated without mentioning the wedge per se (so, without requiring HIT’s), since the statement only needs to talk about maps out of the wedge.

Once again, we believe that the type of the conclusion is an hprop (though we do not prove it) — essentially because it is wrapping up an elimination principle and its corresponding computation rule — and so we make the proof of this result opaque. *)
