(** ** Definition. *)

(** The definition of [Trunc n], the n-truncation of a type.

If Coq supported higher inductive types natively, we would construct this as somthing like:

   Inductive Trunc n (A : Type) : Type :=
   | tr : A -> Trunc n A
   | istrunc_truncation : forall (f : Sphere n.+1 -> Trunc n A)
       (x : Sphere n.+1), f x = f North.

However, while we are faking our higher-inductives anyway, we can take some shortcuts, rather than translating the definition above.  Firstly, we directly posit a “constructor” giving truncatedness, rather than rephrasing it in terms of maps of spheres.  Secondly, we omit the “computation rule” for this constructor, since it is implied by truncatedness of the result type (and, for essentially that reason, is never wanted in practice anyway).

(** [Trunc] is a modality *)

(** We will define a truncation modality to be parametrized by a [trunc_index].  However, as described in Modality.v, we don't want to simply define [Truncation_Modalities.Modality] to *be* [trunc_index]; we want to think of the truncation modality as being *derived from* rather than *identical to* its truncation index.  In particular, there is a coercion [O_reflector] from [Modality] to [Funclass], but we don't want Coq to print things like [2 X] to mean [Trunc 2 X].  However, in the special case of truncation, it is nevertheless convenient for [Truncation_Modalities.Modality] to be definitionally equal to [trunc_index], so that we can call modality functions (particularly connectedness functions) passing a truncation index directly.

These may seem like contradictory requirements, but it appears to be possible to satisfy them because coercions don't unfold definitions.  Thus, rather than a record wrapper, we define a *definitional* wrapper [Truncation_Modality] around [trunc_index], and a notation [Tr] for the identity.  We will define [Truncation_Modalities.Modality] to be [Truncation_Modality] and declare the identity as a coercion; thus a [Truncation_Modality] can be used as a modality and therefore also as a function (via the [O_reflector] coercion).  However, the identity from [trunc_index] to [Truncation_Modality] is not a coercion, so we don't get notation like [2 X]. *)
