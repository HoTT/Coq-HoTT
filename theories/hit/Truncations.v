(** ** Definition. *)

(** The definition of [Trunc n], the n-truncation of a type.

If Coq supported higher inductive types natively, we would construct this as somthing like:

   Inductive Truncation n (A : Type) : Type :=
   | truncation_incl : A -> Truncation n A
   | istrunc_truncation : forall (f : Sphere (trunc_S n) -> Truncation n A)
       (x : Sphere (trunc_S n)), f x = f North.

However, while we are faking our higher-inductives anyway, we can take some shortcuts, rather than translating the definition above.  Firstly, we directly posit a “constructor” giving truncatedness, rather than rephrasing it in terms of maps of spheres.  Secondly, we omit the “computation rule” for this constructor, since it is implied by truncatedness of the result type (and, for essentially that reason, is never wanted in practice anyway).

(** This coercion allows us to use truncation indices where a modality is expected and refer to the corresponding truncation modality.  For instance, the general theory of O-connected maps specializes to the theory of n-connected maps. *)
Coercion truncation_modality : trunc_index >-> Modality.

(** It's sometimes convenient to use "infinity" to refer to the identity modality in a similar way.  This clashes with some uses in higher topos theory, where "oo-truncated" means instead "hypercomplete", but this has not yet been a big problem. *)
