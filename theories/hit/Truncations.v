(** ** Definition. *)

(** The definition of [Trunc n], the n-truncation of a type.

If Coq supported higher inductive types natively, we would construct this as somthing like:

   Inductive Trunc n (A : Type) : Type :=
   | tr : A -> Trunc n A
   | istrunc_truncation : forall (f : Sphere n.+1 -> Trunc n A)
       (x : Sphere n.+1), f x = f North.

However, while we are faking our higher-inductives anyway, we can take some shortcuts, rather than translating the definition above.  Firstly, we directly posit a “constructor” giving truncatedness, rather than rephrasing it in terms of maps of spheres.  Secondly, we omit the “computation rule” for this constructor, since it is implied by truncatedness of the result type (and, for essentially that reason, is never wanted in practice anyway).

(** This definition is doubly sneaky.  Firstly, we define [merely A] to be an inhabitant of the universe [hProp] of hprops, rather than a type.  We can always treat it as a type because there is a coercion, but this means that if we need an element of [hProp] then we don't need a separate name for it.  Secondly, rather than define it as [Trunc -1] we define it as [Tr -1], the action of the truncation modality.  These are of course judgmentally equal, but choosing the latter means that Coq has an easier time applying general modality theorems to it. *)
