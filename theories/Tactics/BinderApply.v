(** There are some cases where [apply lem] will fail, but [intros; apply lem] will succeed.  The tactic [binder apply] is like [intros; apply lem], but it cleans up after itself by [revert]ing the things it introduced.  The tactic [binder apply lem in H] is to [binder apply lem], as [apply lem in H] is to [apply lem].  Note, however, that the implementation of [binder apply lem in H] is completely different and significantly more complicated. *)

We use [match] rather than [lazymatch] so that if the tactic fails to apply under all of the binders, we try again under fewer binders.  We want to try first under as many binders as possible, in case the tactic, e.g., instantiates extra binders with evars. *)

(** The tactic [make_tac_under_binders_using_in tac using_tac H] uses [tac] to transform a term [H], solving side-conditions (e.g., if [tac] uses [apply]) with [using_tac].  It returns the updated version of [H] as a constr; if [H] is a hypothesis in the context, it does not modify it.  Conceptually, [make_tac_under_binders_using_in tac idtac H] is the composition of two tactics: a [transform_under_binders : (constr -> constr) -> (constr -> constr)] that runs a tactic under the binders of the constr it's given, and what would be an [eval tac in H], except for the fact that, e.g., [eval rewrite in H] doesn't actually work because it predates tactics in terms (we use [eval_in_using tac using_tac H] instead).

    The arguments are:

    - [tac] - should take the name of a hypothesis, and modify that hypothesis in place.  It could, for example, be [fun H => rewrite lem in H] to do the [rewrite H] under binders.

    - [using_tac] - used to solve any side-conditions that [tac] generates.  Not strictly necessary, since [tac] can always solve its own side-conditions, but it's sometimes convenient to instantiate [tac] with [fun H => eapply lem in H] or something, and solve the side-conditions with [eassumption].

    - [H] - the name of the hypothesis to start from.

    N.B. We do not require [Funext] to use this tactic; [Funext] would only required to relate the term returned by this tactic and the original term.  Note also that we only rewrite under top-level binders (e.g., under the [x] in a hypothesis of type [forall x, P x], but not under the [x] in a hypothesis of type [(fun x y => x + y) = (fun x y => y + x)]). *)

Proof.
  (** We need to apply [path_forall] under binders five times in [H'].  We use a different variant each time to demonstrate the various ways of using this tactic.  In a normal proof, you'd probably just do [do 4 binder apply (@path_forall _) in H'] or just [repeat binder apply (@path_forall _) in H']. *)
  (** If we do [binder apply path_forall in H'], we are told that Coq can't infer the argument [A] to [path_forall].  Instead, we can [binder eapply] it, to tell Coq to defer inference and use an evar for now. *)
  Fail binder apply path_forall in H'.
  binder eapply path_forall in H'.
  (** Alternatively, we can make [A] explicit.  But then we get an error about not being able to resolve the instance of [Funext].  We can either tell Coq to solve the side condition using the [assumption] tactic (or [typeclasses eauto], for that matter), or we can have typeclass inference run when we construct the lemma to apply. *)
  (** Some versions of Proof General are bad about noticing [Fail] within a tactic; see http://proofgeneral.inf.ed.ac.uk/trac/ticket/494.  So we comment this one out. *)
