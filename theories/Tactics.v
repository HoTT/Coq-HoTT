(** ** Tactics for dealing with [Funext] *)
(** *** Tactics about [transport]ing with [path_forall] *)

(** Given using the variable names from [transport : forall {A : Type} (P : A -> Type) {x y : A}, x = y -> P x -> P y] and [path_forall : {Funext} -> forall {A B} (f g : forall x : A, B x), (forall x : A, f x = g x) -> f = g]:

The high-level idea is that we don't really need functional extensionality if we end up just applying the functions to arguments anyway.  That is, if we have that [forall x, f x = g x], and we only talk about [f y] and [f z], then we don't actually need to transport across [f = g], just [f y = g y] and [f z = g z].

In a bit more detail, if we are transporting across [path_forall f g H], and in the function [P], all instances of [f] are applied to some expressions, say we only see [f x], [f y], ..., [f z], then we can eliminate the [path_forall] by explicitly transporting across [H x], [H y], ..., [H z].  The lemma [path_forall_1_beta] expresses this fact in the case that we see [f] applied to only a single argument in [P], and the tactic [transport_path_forall_hammer] is some fancy Ltac to auto-infer what [P] is and what the argument to [f] is.

The way the tactic does this is by creating an evar for [P] and an evar for the argument to [f], and then using a combination of [assert], [pattern], etc to figure out what each should be.  If you want to see how it works, you can step through each step of [transport_path_forall_hammer] when trying to prove [path_forall_2_beta]. *)

(** The behavior of [simpl rewrite] with respect to implicit arguments is slightly different from that of [rewrite].  In some ways, it is a little more like [erewrite], but in fact both [rewrite] and [erewrite] use magic that we are unable to exactly duplicate with a user-defined tactic.

The point is that for a user-defined tactic, Coq has to resolve the meaning of the term passed to it in some way before the tactic begins executing.  In particular, if that term involves maximally inserted implicit arguments, then it will have to fill them in; but often there will be no way to do that.  If we declared the argument of [simpl rewrite] as a [constr], then this would cause it to fail.  Instead, we declare it as an [open_constr], which allows Coq to fill in those implicit arguments with existential variables, which can then be instantiated later during the rewriting. *)
