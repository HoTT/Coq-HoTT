(** We now give many ways to construct equivalences.  In each case, we define an instance of the typeclass [IsEquiv] named [isequiv_X], followed by an element of the record type [Equiv] named [equiv_X].

   Whenever we need to assume, as a hypothesis, that a certain function is an equivalence, we do it by assuming separately a function and a proof of [IsEquiv].  This is more general than assuming an inhabitant of [Equiv], since the latter has an implicit coercion and an existing instance to give us the former automatically.  Moreover, implicit generalization makes it easy to assume a function and a proof of [IsEquiv]. *)

(** A word on naming: some of the lemmas about equivalences are analogues of those for paths in PathGroupoids.  We name them in an analogous way but adding [_equiv] in an appropriate place, e.g. instead of [moveR_M] we have [moveR_equiv_M].  *)

(** In all the above cases, we were able to directly construct all the structure of an equivalence.  However, as is evident, sometimes it is quite difficult to prove the adjoint law.

It says that if we have all the data of an (adjoint) equivalence except the triangle identity, then we can always obtain the triangle identity by modifying the datum [equiv_is_section] (or [equiv_is_retraction]).  The proof is the same as the standard categorical argument that any equivalence can be improved to an adjoint equivalence.

   As a stylistic matter, we try to avoid using adjointification in the library whenever possible, to preserve the homotopies specified by the user.  *)
