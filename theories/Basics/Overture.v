(** This command prevents Coq from automatically defining the eliminator functions for inductive types.  We will define them ourselves to match the naming scheme of the HoTT Book.  In principle we ought to make this [Global], but unfortunately the tactics [induction] and [elim] assume that the eliminators are named in Coq's way, e.g. [thing_rect], so making it global could cause unpleasant surprises for people defining new inductive types.  However, when you do define your own inductive types you are encouraged to also do [Local Unset Elimination Schemes] and then use [Scheme] to define [thing_ind], [thing_rec], and (for compatibility with [induction] and [elim]) [thing_rect], as we have done below for [paths], [Empty], [Unit], etc.  We are hoping that this will be fixed eventually; see https://github.com/coq/coq/issues/3745.  *)

(** ** Equivalences *)

(** Homotopy equivalences are a central concept in homotopy type theory. Before we define equivalences, let us consider when two types [A] and [B] should be considered "the same".

   The first option is to require existence of [f : A -> B] and [g : B -> A] which are inverses of each other, up to homotopy.  Homotopically speaking, we should also require a certain condition on these homotopies, which is one of the triangle identities for adjunctions in category theory.  Thus, we call this notion an *adjoint equivalence*.

  The other triangle identity is provable from the first one, along with all the higher coherences, so it is reasonable to only assume one of them.  Moreover, as we will see, if we have maps which are inverses up to homotopy, it is always possible to make the triangle identity hold by modifying one of the homotopies.

   The second option is to use Vladimir Voevodsky's definition of an equivalence as a map whose homotopy fibers are contractible.  We call this notion a *homotopy bijection*.

   An interesting third option was suggested by AndrÃ© Joyal: a map [f] which has separate left and right homotopy inverses.  We call this notion a *homotopy isomorphism*.

   While the second option was the one used originally, and it is the most concise one, it makes more sense to use the first one in a formalized development, since it exposes most directly equivalence as a structure.  In particular, it is easier to extract directly from it the data of a homotopy inverse to [f], which is what we care about having most in practice.  Thus, adjoint equivalences are what we will refer to merely as *equivalences*. *)

(** Naming convention: we use [equiv] and [Equiv] systematically to denote types of equivalences, and [isequiv] and [IsEquiv] systematically to denote the assertion that a given map is an equivalence. *)

(** Truncation measures how complicated a type is.  In this library, a witness that a type is n-truncated is formalized by the [IsTrunc n] typeclass.  In many cases, the typeclass machinery of Coq can automatically infer a witness for a type being n-truncated.  Because [IsTrunc n A] itself has no computational content (that is, all witnesses of n-truncation of a type are provably equal), it does not matter much which witness Coq infers.  Therefore, the primary concerns in making use of the typeclass machinery are coverage (how many goals can be automatically solved) and speed (how long does it take to solve a goal, and how long does it take to error on a goal we cannot automatically solve).  Careful use of typeclass instances and priorities, which determine the order of typeclass resolution, can be used to effectively increase both the coverage and the speed in cases where the goal is solvable.  Unfortunately, typeclass resolution tends to spin for a while before failing unless you're very, very, very careful.  We currently aim to achieve moderate coverage and fast speed in solvable cases.  How long it takes to fail typeclass resolution is not currently considered, though it would be nice someday to be even more careful about things.

In order to achieve moderate coverage and speedy resolution, we currently follow the following principles.  They set up a kind of directed flow of information, intended to prevent cycles and potentially infinite chains, which are often the ways that typeclass resolution gets stuck.

- We prefer to reason about [IsTrunc (S n) A] rather than [IsTrunc n (@paths A a b)].  Whenever we see a statement (or goal) about truncation of paths, we try to turn it into a statement (or goal) about truncation of a (non-[paths]) type.  We do not allow typeclass resolution to go in the reverse direction from [IsTrunc (S n) A] to [forall a b : A, IsTrunc n (a = b)].

- We prefer to reason about syntactically smaller types.  That is, typeclass instances should turn goals of type [IsTrunc n (forall a : A, P a)] into goals of type [forall a : A, IsTrunc n (P a)]; and goals of type [IsTrunc n (A * B)] into the pair of goals of type [IsTrunc n A] and [IsTrunc n B]; rather than the other way around.  Ideally, we would add similar rules to transform hypotheses in the cases where we can do so.  This rule is not always the one we want, but it seems to heuristically capture the shape of most cases that we want the typeclass machinery to automatically infer.  That is, we often want to infer [IsTrunc n (A * B)] from [IsTrunc n A] and [IsTrunc n B], but we (probably) don't often need to do other simple things with [IsTrunc n (A * B)] which are broken by that reduction.

(** *** Contractibility and truncation levels *)

(** Truncation measures how complicated a type is in terms of higher path types. The (-2)-truncated types are the contractible ones, whose homotopy is completely trivial.  More precisely, a type [A] is contractible if there is a point [x : A] and a (pointwise) homotopy connecting the identity on [A] to the constant map at [x].

   The (n+1)-truncated types are those whose path types are n-truncated.

   Thus, (-1)-truncated means "the type of paths between any two points is contractible". Such a type is necessarily a sub-singleton: any two points are connected by a path which is unique up to homotopy. In other words, (-1)-truncated types are truth values.  We call such types "propositions" or "h-propositions".

   Next, 0-truncated means "the type of paths between any two points is a sub-singleton". Thus, two points might not have any paths between them, or they have a unique path. Such a type may have many points but it is discrete in the sense that all paths are trivial. We call such types "sets" or "h-sets".

   We begin by defining the type that indexes the truncation levels.

(** We define truncatedness using an inductive type [IsTrunc_internal A n].

An alternative is to use a [Fixpoint], and that was done in the past.  The advantages of the inductive approach are:  [IsTrunc_internal] is cumulative; typeclass inherence works smoothly; the library builds faster.  Some disadvantages are that we need to manually apply the constructors when proving that something is truncated, and that the induction principle is awkward to work with. *)

(** *** Function extensionality *)

(** The function extensionality axiom is formulated as a class. To use it in a theorem, just assume it with [`{Funext}], and then you can use [path_forall], defined below.  If you need function extensionality for a whole development, you can assume it for an entire Section with [Context `{Funext}].  *)
(** We use a dummy class and an axiom to get universe polymorphism of [Funext] while still tracking its uses.  Coq's universe polymorphism is parametric; in all definitions, all universes are quantified over before any other variables.  It's impossible to state a theorem like [(forall i : Level, P i) -> Q] (e.g., "if [C] has all limits of all sizes, then [C] is a preorder" isn't statable).*  By making [isequiv_apD10] an [Axiom] rather than a per-theorem hypothesis, we can use it at multiple incompatible universe levels.  By only allowing use of the axiom when we have a [Funext] in the context, we can still track what theorems depend on it (because their type will mention [Funext]).

    By giving [Funext] a field who's type is an axiom, we guarantee that we cannot construct a fresh instance of [Funext] without [admit]; there's no term of type [dummy_funext_type] floating around.  If we did not give [Funext] and fields, then we could accidentally manifest a [Funext] using, e.g., [constructor], and then we wouldn't have a tag on the theorem that did this.

    As [Funext] is never actually used productively, we toss it in [Type0] and make it [Monomorphic] so it doesn't add more universes.

    * That's not technically true; it might be possible to get non-parametric universe polymorphism using [Module]s and ([Module]) Functors; we can use functors to quantify over a [Module Type] which requires a polymorphic proof of a given hypothesis, and then use that hypothesis polymorphically in any theorem we prove in our new [Module] Functor.  But that is far beyond the scope of this file. *)
