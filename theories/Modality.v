(** Our definition of modality is slightly different from the one in the book, which requires an induction principle only into families of the form [fun oa => O (B oa)], and similarly only that path-spaces of types [O A] are modal, where "modal" means that the unit is an equivalence.  This is equivalent, roughly since every modal type [A] (in this sense) is equivalent to [O A].

However, our definition is more convenient in formalized applications because in some examples (such as [Trunc] and closed modalities), there is a naturally occurring [O_rect] into all modal types that is not judgmentally equal to the one that can be constructed by passing through [O] and back again.  Thus, when we apply general theorems about modalities to a particular modality such as [Trunc], the proofs will reduce definitionally to "the way we would have proved them directly" if we didn't know about general modalities.

On the other hand, in other examples (such as [~~] and open modalities) it is easier to construct the latter weaker induction principle.  Thus, we now show how to get from that to our definition of modality. *)

(** We show that modalities have underlying reflective subuniverses.  It is important in some applications, such as [Trunc], that this construction uses the general [O_rect] given as part of the modality data, and not one constructed out of [O_rectO] as we did when proving [Build_Modality_easy].  For instance, this ensures that [O_functor] reduces to simply an application of [O_rect].

 Note also that our choice of how to define reflective subuniverses differently from the book enables us to prove this without using funext. *)
