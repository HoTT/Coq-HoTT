(** We would like to redefine [symmetry], which is too smart for its own good, as follows:

But this gives "Error: in Tacinterp.add_tacdef: Reserved Ltac name symmetry.".  This might be fixed with https://coq.inria.fr/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=3113.  For now, you can [apply symmetry] or [eapply symmetry].  (Note that we can get around this error message by using [Tactic Notation "symmetry"], but, confusingly, this tactic notation never gets called. *)

(** ** Basic definitions *)

(** Define an alias for [Set], which is really [Typeâ‚€]. *)
Notation Type0 := Set.

(** We make the identity map a notation so we do not have to unfold it,
    or complicate matters with its type. *)
Notation idmap := (fun x => x).

(** We define notation for dependent pairs because it is too annoying to write and see [existT P x y] all the time.  However, we put it in its own scope, because sometimes it is necessary to give the particular dependent type, so we'd like to be able to turn off this notation selectively. *)
Notation "( x ; y )" := (existT _ x y) : fibration_scope.
Open Scope fibration_scope.

(** We have unified [sig] and [sigT] of the standard Coq, and so we introduce a new notation to not annoy newcomers with the [T] in [projT1] and [projT2] nor the [_sig] in [proj1_sig] and [proj2_sig], and to not confuse Coq veterans by stealing [proj1] and [proj2], which Coq uses for [and]. *)
Notation pr1 := projT1.
Notation pr2 := projT2.

(** The following notation is very convenient, although it unfortunately clashes with Proof General's "electric period". *)
Notation "x .1" := (projT1 x) (at level 3) : fibration_scope.
Notation "x .2" := (projT2 x) (at level 3) : fibration_scope.

(** Composition of functions. *)
Definition compose {A B C : Type} (g : B -> C) (f : A -> B) :=
  fun x => g (f x).

Hint Unfold compose.

(** We put the following notation in a scope because leaving it unscoped causes it to override identical notations in other scopes.  It's convenient to use the same notation for, e.g., function composition, morphism composition in a category, and functor composition, and let Coq automatically infer which one we mean by scopes.  We can't do this if this notation isn't scoped.  Unfortunately, Coq doesn't have a built-in [function_scope] like [type_scope]; [type_scope] is automatically opened wherever Coq is expecting a [Sort], and it would be nice if [function_scope] were automatically opened whenever Coq expects a thing of type [forall _, _] or [_ -> _].  To work around this, we open [function_scope] globally. *)
Notation "g 'o' f" := (compose g f) (at level 40, left associativity) : function_scope.
Open Scope function_scope.

(** ** The groupoid structure of identity types. *)

(** The results in this file are used everywhere else, so we need to be extra careful about how we define and prove things.  We prefer hand-written terms, or at least tactics that allow us to retain clear control over the proof-term produced. *)

(** We define our own identity type, rather than using the one in the Coq standard library, so as to have more control over transitivity, symmetry and inverse.  It seems impossible to change these for the standard eq/identity type (or its Type-valued version) because it breaks various other standard things.  Merely changing notations also doesn't seem to quite work. *)

Definition concat {A : Type} {x y z : A} (p : x = y) (q : y = z) : x = z :=

Definition inverse {A : Type} {x y : A} (p : x = y) : y = x

(** Declaring this as [simpl nomatch] prevents the tactic [simpl] from expanding it out into [match] statements.  We only want [inverse] to simplify when applied to an identity path. *)
Arguments inverse {A x y} p : simpl nomatch.

Instance symmetric_paths {A} : Symmetric (@paths A) | 0 := @inverse A.


(** Note that you can use the built-in Coq tactics [reflexivity] and [transitivity] when working with paths, but not [symmetry], because it is too smart for its own good.  Instead, you can write [apply symmetry] or [eapply symmetry]. *)

(** The identity path. *)

(** An alternative notation which puts each path on its own line.  Useful as a temporary device during proofs of equalities between very long composites; to turn it on inside a section, say [Open Scope long_path_scope]. *)
Notation "p @' q" := (concat p q) (at level 21, left associativity,
  format "'[v' p '/' '@''  q ']'") : long_path_scope.


(** An important instance of [paths_rect] is that given any dependent type, one can _transport_ elements of instances of the type along equalities in the base.

   [transport P p u] transports [u : P x] to [P y] along [p : x = y]. *)
Definition transport {A : Type} (P : A -> Type) {x y : A} (p : x = y) (u : P x) : P y :=
  match p with idpath => u end.

(** See above for the meaning of [simpl nomatch]. *)
Arguments transport {A} P {x y} p%path_scope u : simpl nomatch.

(** Transport is very common so it is worth introducing a parsing notation for it.  However, we do not use the notation for output because it hides the fibration, and so makes it very hard to read involved transport expression.*)
Delimit Scope fib_scope with fib.
Local Open Scope fib_scope.

Notation "p # x" := (transport _ p x) (right associativity, at level 65, only parsing) : path_scope.

(** Having defined transport, we can use it to talk about what a homotopy theorist might see as "paths in a fibration over paths in the base"; and what a type theorist might see as "heterogeneous eqality in a dependent type".

We will first see this appearing in the type of [apD]. *)

(** Functions act on paths: if [f : A -> B] and [p : x = y] is a path in [A], then [ap f p : f x = f y].

   We typically pronounce [ap] as a single syllable, short for "application"; but it may also be considered as an acronym, "action on paths". *)

Definition ap {A B:Type} (f:A -> B) {x y:A} (p:x = y) : f x = f y
  := match p with idpath => idpath end.

(** We introduce the convention that [apKN] denotes the application of a K-path between
   functions to an N-path between elements, where a 0-path is simply a function or an
   element. Thus, [ap] is a shorthand for [ap01]. *)

Proof.
  case h, p; reflexivity.
Defined.

(** See above for the meaning of [simpl nomatch]. *)
Arguments ap {A B} f {x y} p : simpl nomatch.

(** Similarly, dependent functions act on paths; but the type is a bit more subtle. If [f : forall a:A, B a] and [p : x = y] is a path in [A], then [apD f p] should somehow be a path between [f x : B x] and [f y : B y]. Since these live in different types, we use transport along [p] to make them comparable: [apD f p : p # f x = f y].

  The type [p # f x = f y] can profitably be considered as a heterogeneous or dependent equality type, of "paths from [f x] to [f y] over [p]". *)

Definition apD {A:Type} {B:A->Type} (f:forall a:A, B a) {x y:A} (p:x=y):
  p # (f x) = f y
  :=
  match p with idpath => idpath end.

(** See above for the meaning of [simpl nomatch]. *)
Arguments apD {A B} f {x y} p : simpl nomatch.

(** ** Equivalences *)

(** Homotopy equivalences are a central concept in homotopy type theory. Before we define equivalences, let us consider when two types [A] and [B] should be considered "the same".

   The first option is to require existence of [f : A -> B] and [g : B -> A] which are inverses of each other, up to homotopy.  Homotopically speaking, we should also require a certain condition on these homotopies, which is one of the triangle identities for adjunctions in category theory.  Thus, we call this notion an *adjoint equivalence*.

  The other triangle identity is provable from the first one, along with all the higher coherences, so it is reasonable to only assume one of them.  Moreover, as we will see, if we have maps which are inverses up to homotopy, it is always possible to make the triangle identity hold by modifying one of the homotopies.

   The second option is to use Vladimir Voevodsky's definition of an equivalence as a map whose homotopy fibers are contractible.  We call this notion a *homotopy bijection*.

   An interesting third option was suggested by AndrÃ© Joyal: a map [f] which has separate left and right homotopy inverses.  We call this notion a *homotopy isomorphism*.

   While the second option was the one used originally, and it is the most concise one, it makes more sense to use the first one in a formalized development, since it exposes most directly equivalence as a structure.  In particular, it is easier to extract directly from it the data of a homotopy inverse to [f], which is what we care about having most in practice.  Thus, adjoint equivalences are what we will refer to merely as *equivalences*. *)

(** Naming convention: we use [equiv] and [Equiv] systematically to denote types of equivalences, and [isequiv] and [IsEquiv] systematically to denote the assertion that a given map is an equivalence. *)

(** The fact that [r] is a left inverse of [s]. As a mnemonic, note that the partially applied type [Sect s] is the type of proofs that [s] is a section. *)
Definition Sect {A B : Type} (s : A -> B) (r : B -> A) :=
  forall x : A, r (s x) = x.

(** A typeclass that includes the data making [f] into an adjoint equivalence. *)

  equiv_inv : B -> A ;

Notation "A <~> B" := (Equiv A B) (at level 85) : equiv_scope.

(** A notation for the inverse of an equivalence.  We can apply this to a function as long as there is a typeclass instance asserting it to be an equivalence.  We can also apply it to an element of [A <~> B], since there is an implicit coercion to [A -> B] and also an existing instance of [IsEquiv]. *)

Notation "f ^-1" := (@equiv_inv _ _ f _) (at level 3) : equiv_scope.

(** ** Contractibility and truncation levels *)

(** Truncation measures how complicated a type is.  In this library, a witness that a type is n-truncated is formalized by the [IsTrunc n] typeclass.  In many cases, the typeclass machinery of Coq can automatically infer a witness for a type being n-truncated.  Because [IsTrunc n A] itself has no computational content (that is, all witnesses of n-truncation of a type are provably equal), it does not matter much which witness Coq infers.  Therefore, the primary concerns in making use of the typeclass machinery are coverage (how many goals can be automatically solved) and speed (how long does it take to solve a goal, and how long does it take to error on a goal we cannot automatically solve).  Careful use of typeclass instances and priorities, which determine the order of typeclass resolution, can be used to effectively increase both the coverage and the speed in cases where the goal is solvable.  Unfortunately, typeclass resolution tends to spin for a while before failing unless you're very, very, very careful.  We currently aim to achieve moderate coverage and fast speed in solvable cases.  How long it takes to fail typeclass resolution is not currently considered, though it would be nice someday to be even more careful about things.

In order to achieve moderate coverage and speedy resolution, we currently follow the following principles.  They set up a kind of directed flow of information, intended to prevent cycles and potentially infinite chains, which are often the ways that typeclass resolution gets stuck.

- We prefer to reason about [IsTrunc (S n) A] rather than [IsTrunc n (@paths A a b)].  Whenever we see a statement (or goal) about truncation of paths, we try to turn it into a statement (or goal) about truncation of a (non-[paths]) type.  We do not allow typeclass resolution to go in the reverse direction from [IsTrunc (S n) A] to [forall a b : A, IsTrunc n (a = b)].

- We prefer to reason about syntactically smaller types.  That is, typeclass instances should turn goals of type [IsTrunc n (forall a : A, P a)] into goals of type [forall a : A, IsTrunc n (P a)]; and goals of type [IsTrunc n (A * B)] into the pair of goals of type [IsTrunc n A] and [IsTrunc n B]; rather than the other way around.  Ideally, we would add similar rules to transform hypotheses in the cases where we can do so.  This rule is not always the one we want, but it seems to heuristically capture the shape of most cases that we want the typeclass machinery to automatically infer.  That is, we often want to infer [IsTrunc n (A * B)] from [IsTrunc n A] and [IsTrunc n B], but we (probably) don't often need to do other simple things with [IsTrunc n (A * B)] which are broken by that reduction.
*)

(** *** Contractibility *)

(** A space [A] is contractible if there is a point [x : A] and a (pointwise) homotopy connecting the identity on [A] to the constant map at [x].  Thus an element of [contr A] is a pair whose first component is a point [x] and the second component is a pointwise retraction of [A] to [x]. *)

(** We use the [Contr_internal] record so as not to pollute typeclass search; we only do truncation typeclass search on the [IsTrunc] datatype, usually.  We will define a notation [Contr] which is equivalent to [Contr_internal], but picked up by typeclass search.  However, we must make [Contr_internal] a class so that we pick up typeclasses on [center] and [contr].  However, the only typeclass rule we register is the one that turns it into a [Contr]/[IsTrunc].  Unfortunately, this means that declaring an instance like [Instance contr_foo : Contr foo := { center := bar }.] will fail with mismatched instances/contexts.  Instead, we must iota expand such definitions to get around Coq's deficiencies, and write [Instance contr_foo : Contr foo := let x := {| center := bar |} in x.] *)
Class Contr_internal (A : Type) := BuildContr {
  center : A ;
  contr : (forall y : A, center = y)
}.

Arguments center A {_}.

(** *** Truncation levels *)

(** Truncation measures how complicated a type is in terms of higher path spaces. The (-2)-truncated types are the contractible ones, whose homotopy is completely trivial. The (n+1)-truncated types are those whose path spaces are n-truncated.

   Thus, (-1)-truncated means "the space of paths between any two points is contactible". Such a space is necessarily a sub-singleton: any two points are connected by a path which is unique up to homotopy. In other words, (-1)-truncated spaces are truth values (we call them "propositions").

   Next, 0-truncated means "the space of paths between any two points is a sub-singleton". Thus, two points might not have any paths between them, or they have a unique path. Such a space may have many points but it is discrete in the sense that all paths are trivial. We call such spaces "sets".

(** The tactic [f_ap] is a replacement for the previously existing standard library tactic [f_equal].

The [done] tactic is used to detect the [f = f] case and finish, and the [trivial] is used to solve, e.g., [x = x] when using [f_ap] on [f y x = f z x].  This tactic only works for non-dependently-typed functions; we cannot express [y = w] in the first example if [y] and [w] have different types.  If and when Arnaud's new-tacticals branch lands, and we can have a goal which depends on the term used to discharge another goal, then this tactic should probably be generalized to deal with dependent functions. *)
Ltac f_ap :=
  lazymatch goal with
    | [ |- ?f ?x = ?g ?x ] => apply (@apD10 _ _ f g);
                             try (done || f_ap)
    | _ => apply ap11;
          [ done || f_ap
          | trivial ]
  end.

(** [expand] replaces both terms of an equality (either [paths] or [pointwise_paths] in the goal with their head normal forms *)
Ltac expand :=
  match goal with
    | [ |- ?X = ?Y ] =>
      let X' := eval hnf in X in let Y' := eval hnf in Y in change (X' = Y')
    | [ |- ?X == ?Y ] =>
      let X' := eval hnf in X in let Y' := eval hnf in Y in change (X' == Y')
  end; simpl.

(** [atomic x] is the same as [idtac] if [x] is a variable or hypothesis, but is [fail 0] if [x] has internal structure. *)
Ltac atomic x :=
  match x with
    | ?f _ => fail 1 x "is not atomic"
    | (fun _ => _) => fail 1 x "is not atomic"
    | forall _, _ => fail 1 x "is not atomic"
    | _ => idtac
