(** ** Path algebra helper lemma *)

(** Here is a strange-looking path algebra helper lemma that is easier to prove by lifting to a general case and doing a path-induction blast.  It says something about what happens when we transport from the center of a based path-space to some other point, assuming we know a particular way to "compute" the action of the type family in question. *)
