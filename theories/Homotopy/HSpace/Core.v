(** * H-spaces *)

(** A (noncoherent) H-space [X] is a pointed type with a binary operation for which the base point is a both a left and a right identity. (See Coherent.v for the notion of a coherent H-space.) We say [X] is left-invertible if left multiplication by any element is an equivalence, and dually for right-invertible. *)

(** ** Promoting unpointed homotopies to pointed homotopies *)

(** Two pointed maps [f g : Y ->* X] into an H-space are equal if and only if they are equal as unpointed maps. (Note: This is a logical "iff", not an equivalence of types.) This was first observed by Evan Cavallo for homogeneous types. Below we show a generalization due to Egbert Rijke, which we then specialize to H-spaces. Notably, the specialization does not require left-invertibility. This appears as Lemma 2.6 in https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02636v1 *)
