(** * Characterization of identity types by identity systems *)

(** See Homotopy/EncodeDecode.v for a related characterization of identity types. *)

(** To avoid dependencies coming from Pointed.Core, we will write out some of the definitions found there. Let [A : Type], together with a distinguished base point [a0 : A]. A pointed type family is a type family [R : A -> Type], together with a distinguished point [r0 : R a0]. A pointed type family [(R; r0)] is called an identity system if it satisfies the J-rule. Given a pointed type family [(R; r0)], the fundamental theorem of identity systems (Theorem 5.8.2 from the HoTT Book) tells us that the following are equivalent: (i) an identity system structure on [(R; r0)], (ii) homotopy contractibility of the space of pointed type family maps from [(R; r0)] to any pointed type family [(S; s0)], (iii) transport along [R] being an equivalence, and (iv) the total space of [R] being contractible. *)
Class IsIdentitySystem {A : Type} {a0 : A} (R : A -> Type) (r0 : R a0) := {
    idsys_ind (D : forall a : A, R a -> Type) (d : D a0 r0) (a : A) (r : R a)
      : D a r;
    idsys_ind_beta (D : forall a : A, R a -> Type) (d : D a0 r0)
      : idsys_ind D d a0 r0 = d
  }.

(** The mapping space between two pointed type families over the same pointed type is a family of maps that preserves the distinguished points. *)
Definition pfamMap {A : Type} {a0 : A} (R S : A -> Type) (r0 : R a0) (s0 : S a0)
  := {f : forall a : A, R a -> S a & f a0 r0 = s0}.

(** A pointed homotopy between maps of pointed type families is a family of homotopies that is pointed in the fiber over [a0]. *)

(** We weaken part (ii) of Theorem 5.8.2. Instead of requiring that the mapping space is contractible, we will only require it to be homotopy contractible, i.e. it is inhabited and there is a homotopy between every map and the chosen map. This allows us to avoid function extensionality. Given that a pointed type family [(R; r0)] is an identity system, then the mapping space of pointed type families from [(R; r0)] to any [(S; s0)] is homotopy contractible. This is a weak form of Theorem 5.8.2, (i) implies (ii). *)

(** If a pointed type family [(R; r0)] has homotopy contractible mapping spaces in the sense above, then [fun p => transport R p r0] is a fiberwise equivalence. This is a strong form of Theorem 5.8.2, (ii) implies (iii). *)

(** The fundamental theorem of identity systems is now proven. It is useful to write down some of the composite implications. Given an identity system [(R; r0)], transporting the point [r0] induces a fiberwise equivalence between the based path type [a0 = x] and [R x]. This is Theorem 5.8.2 (i) implies (iii). *)

(** A more general version of Theorem 5.8.2 (iii) implies (i) is proven in Basics/Equivalences.v as [equiv_path_ind]. The original statement is recovered if [e] is assumed to be [fun p => transport R p r0]. *)

(** This is another result for characterizing the path types of [A] when given an equivalence [e : B <~> A], such as an [issig] lemma for [A]. It can help Coq to deduce the type family [P] if [revert] is used to move [a0] and [a1] into the goal, if needed. *)

(** After [equiv_path_issig_contr], we are left showing the contractibility of a sigma-type whose base and fibers are large nested sigma-types of the same depth.  Moreover, we expect that the types appearing in those two large nested sigma-types "pair up" to form contractible based "path-types".  The following lemma "peels off" the first such pair, whose contractibility can often be found with typeclass search.  The remaining contractibility goal is then simplified by substituting the center of contraction of that first based "path-type", or more precisely a *specific* center that may or may not be the one given by the contractibility instance; the latter freedom sometimes makes things faster and simpler. *)
